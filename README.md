A test scenario of a town with citizens being chased by a hunter. The citizens should use their environment and behaviour to trick the hunter in order to escape.

Might use the mario paper as reference: http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf
Or the alphastar paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01724.pdf

But will start out with a random update approach.
